    h1 Building the PCB 
    p The PCB is the substrate on which the switches are connected. It hosts the microcontroller, the LEDs and any other features you with to add. It also provides a mechanical connection between the switches, and can make a board more stiff. You will have control over every aspect of this circuit borad, and you can tailor it to your liking and needs.
    h1 Getting Started: 
    p Download 
        a(href="https://kicad.org") kicad 
    p Kicad is a software that we will use to design the schematic, route the PCB, and place all of the components that we need to use. 
    p Once you have Kicad downloaded, open it and create a new project. Save it to a folder that you have easy access to. 
    p In a new web browser tab, open 
        a(href="https://github.com" target="_blank") GitHub 
    p Sign in / Create an account. Click the green button that says Create a new repository.
    p Name your repository. I'm going to use `Keyboard-return`. Give the repository a description. For my project, I'm going to use `A mechanical keyboard with detachable numpad, OLED displays, rotary encoders, and QMK firmware. ` but yours should be different. It should be a description of the features of your keyboard as well as any special processes you used to design it. 
    p Select 'Add a Readme file. This will serve as the front page of your repository.'
    p For the gitignore template, select Kicad. This will help prevent sensitive information from making its way onto the public internet. 
    p Click create repository.
